# hello-world
wha yo' n fo'
I will always try to make this stuff useful to at least one other person...and fun to more.

I'd like to start with an app to save me time and aggravation when importing pics from my iPhones and SLRs (Cameras) by using pcture metadata to move files into "month-taken" folders

after confirming this process is robust, I'd really like to begin to work with image processing
